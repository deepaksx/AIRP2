      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfeat: Complete Event Sourcing + CQRS Implementation v2.1.0\n\nSuccessfully implemented and tested full Event Sourcing architecture with Kafka event streaming.\n\n## Major Achievements:\n\n### 1. Kafka Serialization Fix (CRITICAL)\n- **Problem**: NestJS ClientProxy.emit() was serializing all objects as \"[object Object]\"\n- **Solution**: Replaced NestJS Kafka abstraction with raw KafkaJS producer\n- **Result**: Events now publish with proper JSON to Kafka\n\n### 2. Event Sourcing Flow (WORKING END-TO-END)\n**Ledger Writer Service**:\n- Events stored in event_store table with checksums\n- Events published to Kafka with raw KafkaJS producer  \n- Explicit JSON.stringify() for proper serialization\n\n**Projection Service**:\n- Consumes events from Kafka using raw KafkaJS consumer\n- Updates gl_balances table with fiscal period aggregation\n- Refreshes trial_balance materialized view\n- Proper account lookup from chart_of_accounts\n\n### 3. Database Architecture\n- event_store: Immutable event log with partitioning\n- gl_balances: Account balances by fiscal year/period\n- trial_balance: Materialized view for reporting\n- chart_of_accounts: Master account data\n\n### 4. Files Modified\n\n**services/ledger-writer/src/events/event-store.service.ts**:\n- Removed NestJS ClientProxy injection\n- Added raw Kafka producer with lifecycle management\n- Implemented explicit JSON.stringify() in producer.send()\n\n**services/ledger-writer/src/events/event-store.module.ts**:\n- Removed ClientsModule configuration\n- Simplified to TypeORM only\n\n**services/projection-service/src/projections/gl-balance.entity.ts** (NEW):\n- Entity for gl_balances table\n- Supports fiscal year/period aggregation\n\n**services/projection-service/src/projections/chart-of-accounts.entity.ts** (NEW):\n- Entity for chart_of_accounts table\n- Maps account_code to account_id\n\n**services/projection-service/src/projections/projection.service.ts**:\n- Replaced stub implementation with real GL balance updates\n- Looks up account_id from chart_of_accounts\n- Calculates fiscal year/period from entry date\n- Updates gl_balances with proper debits/credits\n- Refreshes trial_balance materialized view\n\n**services/projection-service/src/app.module.ts**:\n- Added GLBalanceEntity and ChartOfAccountsEntity\n\n### 5. Verified End-to-End Flow\n1. âœ… POST journal entry â†’ Ledger Writer\n2. âœ… Event stored in event_store\n3. âœ… Event published to Kafka (proper JSON)\n4. âœ… Projection Service consumes event\n5. âœ… GL balances updated in database\n6. âœ… Trial Balance view refreshed\n7. âœ… Data queryable via Trial Balance\n\n### 6. Test Results\nPosted journal entry:\n- Account 1200 (AR): 30,000 AED debit\n- Account 4000 (Revenue): 30,000 AED credit\n\nVerified in database:\n- gl_balances: 2 rows with correct amounts\n- trial_balance: Shows both accounts with balances\n\n## Technical Notes:\n- NestJS Kafka serialization is fundamentally broken for complex objects\n- Raw KafkaJS provides full control over serialization\n- Trial Balance is a materialized view, not a table\n- GL balances use unique constraint (tenant_id, account_id, fiscal_year, fiscal_period, currency)\n\nðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")"
