- **Account Name**: Full account name (e.g., "Office Supplies Expense")
- **Confidence Score**: 0.0 to 1.0 (higher is better)
- **Reasoning**: AI explanation for why this account was chosen

#### Step 4: Review and Use Results

**High Confidence (0.8 - 1.0)**: ‚úÖ Safe to auto-post
```
Account: 5500 - Office Supplies
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: "Office supplies" keyword detected, amount consistent with typical purchases
```

**Medium Confidence (0.5 - 0.79)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Review before posting
```
Account: 5100 - COGS
Confidence: 0.65
Reasoning: Ambiguous description, recommend manual review
```

**Low Confidence (< 0.5)**: ‚ùå Requires manual classification
```
Account: 5900 - Miscellaneous
Confidence: 0.35
Reasoning: Unable to determine account from description
```

### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: You receive an invoice from Staples for office supplies

**Input**:

### How RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Works

**Step 1: Document Indexing**
Your company's policy documents are:
1. Converted to text
2. Split into chunks
3. Converted to vector embeddings
4. Stored in Qdrant vector database

**Step 2: Query Processing**
When you ask a question:
1. Question is converted to vector embedding
2. Most relevant policy sections are retrieved
3. Context is sent to AI model
4. AI generates answer based on actual policy text

**Step 3: Answer Generation**
AI provides:
- Direct answer from your policies (not generic advice)
- Source citations (section and document)
- Confidence score (high/medium/low)

### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: Employee wants to reimburse 1,250 AED for client dinner

**Question**: "Can I expense a client dinner that cost 1,250 AED?"

**AI Response**:
```
Answer: Yes, with the following requirements:

Client entertainment meals are reimbursable under the following conditions:
‚Ä¢ Maximum amount: AED 200 per person
‚Ä¢ Approval required: Department Head (for amounts over AED 500)
‚Ä¢ Documentation required:
  - Original itemized receipt
  - List of attendees (names, companies)
  - Business purpose statement

For your AED 1,250 expense:
‚Ä¢ Ensure you have 6 or fewer attendees (AED 1,250 √∑ AED 200 = 6.25)
‚Ä¢ If more than 6 attendees, only AED 1,200 will be approved
‚Ä¢ Submit within 30 days with all required documentation
‚Ä¢ Obtain Department Head pre-approval

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Alcohol expenses are NOT reimbursable per UAE compliance
          requirements (Policy Section 4.5)

Source: Entertainment Expense Policy v1.8, Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.5
Last Updated: March 1, 2025

#### Step 3: Review Query Interpretation

**ChatERP shows you**:
1. **Interpreted Intent**: What it thinks you're asking
2. **Generated SQL**: The actual database query
3. **Confidence Score**: How confident it is (0-100%)

**Example**:
```
Your Question: "Show me unpaid invoices over 10,000 AED"

Interpreted Intent: Retrieve AP invoices with status 'unpaid' and
                   total_amount > 10000

Generated SQL:
SELECT invoice_number, vendor_name, invoice_date, total_amount, days_overdue
FROM ap_invoices
WHERE payment_status = 'unpaid'
  AND total_amount > 10000
  AND tenant_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'
ORDER BY invoice_date DESC

Confidence: 95%
```

#### Step 4: Approve or Modify Query

**High Confidence (90-100%)**: ‚úÖ Execute immediately
- SQL looks correct
- Intent matches your question
- Safe to run

**Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Review before executing
- Check SQL for accuracy
- Verify table/column names
- May need refinement

**Low Confidence (<70%)**: ‚ùå Rephrase question
- AI unsure about intent
- May produce incorrect results
- Ask more specific question

**Actions**:
- **‚úÖ Execute Query**: Run the SQL and see results

### Real-World Example

**Scenario**: Finance Manager needs to review large overdue AP invoices before board meeting

**Conversation**:
```
User: Show me all unpaid invoices over 20,000 AED that are more than 30 days old

ChatERP: [Generates and displays SQL]
Results: 3 invoices found
‚Ä¢ INV-AP-2025-042: Emirates IT - 45,000 AED (35 days overdue)
‚Ä¢ INV-AP-2025-033: Dubai Consulting - 18,750 AED (25 days old) ‚ùå Not 30+ days
‚Ä¢ INV-AP-2025-029: Tech Equipment - 22,000 AED (22 days old) ‚ùå Not 30+ days

User: Wait, that's not right. Two of these aren't 30+ days old.

ChatERP: You're correct. Let me refine the query to only show invoices
         with days_overdue >= 30.

[Generates corrected SQL]
Results: 1 invoice found
‚Ä¢ INV-AP-2025-042: Emirates IT - 45,000 AED (35 days overdue)

User: Perfect. Send payment reminder to this vendor.

ChatERP: ‚úÖ Payment reminder email sent to Emirates IT Solutions
         Subject: "Outstanding Invoice INV-AP-2025-042 - 35 Days Overdue"
```

### Natural Language Capabilities

**ChatERP Understands**:
- **Time References**: "last month", "this week", "yesterday", "Q3 2025"
- **Comparisons**: "greater than", "less than", "between", "top 5"
- **Aggregations**: "total", "average", "count", "sum"
- **Sorting**: "highest", "lowest", "most recent", "oldest"
- **Filtering**: "unpaid", "overdue", "posted", "active"
- **Joins**: "invoices with vendor names", "entries with account details"

**Example Translations**:
```
"Last month" ‚Üí WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
"Over 10,000 AED" ‚Üí WHERE amount > 10000
"Top 5" ‚Üí ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 5
"Unpaid" ‚Üí WHERE payment_status = 'unpaid'
```

### Security & Permissions

**What ChatERP CAN Do**:
- ‚úÖ SELECT queries (read data)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Services Not Responding

**Symptom**: AI service returns timeout or connection error

**Solutions**:
1. Check service status:
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=ai"
   ```
2. Verify all AI containers are "healthy"
3. Restart unhealthy services:
   ```bash
   docker restart airp-ai-[service-name]
   ```
4. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   docker logs airp-ai-[service-name] --tail 50
   ```

### Low Confidence Scores

**Symptom**: AI returns confidence score <50%

**Solutions**:
1. **Rephrase your question**: Use more specific language
2. **Add context**: Include amounts, dates, or other details
3. **Use examples**: "Like invoice ABC-123"
4. **Check spelling**: Verify vendor/account names
5. **Break into smaller questions**: Simplify complex queries

### Incorrect Classification

**Symptom**: AI classifies to wrong GL account

**Solutions**:
1. **Provide more details**: Add vendor name and amount
2. **Review reasoning**: Check AI explanation for logic
3. **Manual override**: Select correct account and provide feedback
4. **Update training data**: Corrections improve future accuracy
5. **Check confidence**: Low confidence = needs review

### Reconciliation Mismatches

**Symptom**: AI matches wrong transactions

**Solutions**:
1. **Check match score**: Only accept matches >85%
2. **Review date ranges**: Ensure consistent periods
3. **Verify amounts**: Check for currency or decimal errors
4. **Investigate descriptions**: Bank may use different vendor names
5. **Manual reconciliation**: Some transactions require human judgment

### Forecast Inaccuracy

**Symptom**: Forecast doesn't match actual results

**Solutions**:
1. **Use more history**: Minimum 6 months, 12+ recommended
2. **Account for one-time events**: Large purchases skew predictions
3. **Update regularly**: Weekly/monthly re-forecasting
4. **Check seasonality**: Ensure seasonal patterns detected
5. **Adjust confidence intervals**: Use wider bounds (90% vs 80%)

### Policy Advisor No Answer

**Symptom**: "I couldn't find information about that policy"

**Solutions**:
1. **Rephrase question**: Use different keywords
2. **Check policy documents**: Ensure uploaded to system
3. **Verify Qdrant health**: `docker ps | grep qdrant`
4. **Ask simpler question**: Break complex queries into parts
5. **Contact admin**: Policy documents may need re-indexing

### ChatERP Query Errors

**Symptom**: Generated SQL fails to execute

**Solutions**:
1. **Review SQL**: Check for syntax errors
2. **Verify table names**: Use "Show Schema" to confirm
3. **Rephrase question**: AI may have misunderstood intent
4. **Check permissions**: Ensure you have access to requested data
5. **Report bug**: If SQL looks correct but fails, report to admin
