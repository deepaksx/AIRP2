**Expected Response Example**:
```
🤖 I found 2 vendors that sell office supplies:

1. Emirates Office Supplies LLC
   - Vendor Code: V001
   - Products: Office supplies, stationery, printing
   - Payment Terms: Net 30
   - Typical GL Account: 5500 - Office Supplies

2. Dubai Stationery & More
   - Vendor Code: V008
   - Products: Stationery, paper, desk accessories
   - Payment Terms: Net 30
   - Typical GL Account: 5500 - Office Supplies

These vendors were identified based on AI-generated context metadata
that understands their business type and product categories.

## 📈 Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

**Service Health**:
```powershell
# Check every 5 minutes
curl http://localhost:8007/health
```

**Database Performance**:
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE indexname LIKE '%context%'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Check context generation coverage
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors WHERE ai_context_summary IS NOT NULL) as vendors_with_context,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors) as total_vendors,
  ROUND(100.0 * (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors WHERE ai_context_summary IS NOT NULL) /
        NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vendors), 0), 2) as coverage_pct;
```

**AI API Usage**:
```powershell
# Check logs for API errors
docker compose logs ai-context-generator | Select-String "ERROR"

# Check context generation rate
docker compose logs ai-context-generator | Select-String "Generated context"
```

**User Activity**:
```powershell
# Check ChatERP usage (access logs)
docker compose logs -f | Select-String "chaterp.html"

# Check query patterns (what users are asking)
docker compose logs ai-query-parser | Select-String "POST /parse-query"
```

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: AI Context Generator won't start**
```
Error: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set
```
**Solution**: Add API key to .env file
```powershell
notepad C:/Dev/AIRP2/.env
# Add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
docker compose restart ai-context-generator
```

**Issue 2: Context generation fails**
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized from Anthropic API
```
**Solution**: Verify API key is valid
```powershell
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages `
  -H "x-api-key: $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" `
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" `
  -H "content-type: application/json" `
  -d '{\"model\":\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\"max_tokens\":100,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Test\"}]}'
```

**Issue 3: Keyword search returns no results**
```
Query: "Who sells office supplies?"
Result: No vendors found
```
**Solution**: Generate contexts first
```powershell
.\run_generate_contexts.ps1
```

**Issue 4: ChatERP shows dark theme**
```
Theme: Dark background instead of SAP light theme
```
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and refresh
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
```

**Issue 5: Database migration fails**
```
Error: relation "vendors" does not exist
```
**Solution**: Verify database initialization
